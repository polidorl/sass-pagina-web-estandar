## Overview

Using Sass programming in real projects: setting global variables, building for reuse.

Modern responsive design: flexible images, using media queries to test different screen widths,

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page from the designs provided in the starter code.

The objective is the users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building with

1. Initialize the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).  

2. Configure the repository  publish it your code to a web address. 

3. Look  the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

4.  Structure the content  of file : index . html .

5. After that write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
